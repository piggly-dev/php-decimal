# Documentation

An arbitrary-precision `Decimal` class type for **PHP**.

All documentation will be typed soon, for now you may go to [decimal.js API](https://mikemcl.github.io/decimal.js/) since this library is fully compatible with it.

The main different are the static methods to `Decimal` class, where they will always end with `Of`, e.g.: `Decimal.abs(x)` -> `Decimal::absOf($x)`.
